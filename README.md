# OpenCV Project

This project contains various examples demonstrating the use of OpenCV for image and video processing. Below is a brief overview of each file in the project.

## Files Overview

- **openWebcam.py**: Captures video from the webcam and displays it in a window. The video feed continues until the user presses 'q' to quit.

- **basicExamples/readImage.py**: Demonstrates how to read an image from a file and display it using OpenCV.

- **basicExamples/writeImage.py**: Shows how to write an image to a file using OpenCV.

- **basicExamples/drawShapes.py**: Illustrates how to draw basic shapes (lines, rectangles, circles) on an image using OpenCV.

- **basicExamples/imageThresholding.py**: Demonstrates various image thresholding techniques using OpenCV.

- **basicExamples/videoCapture.py**: Captures video from the webcam and displays it, similar to `openWebcam.py`, but may include additional processing or features.

## Requirements

To run the examples, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed. You can install OpenCV using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run any of the example scripts using Python. For example:

```
python openWebcam.py
```

Feel free to explore and modify the examples to better understand OpenCV functionalities!
